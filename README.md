# Insurance_Cost_Predictions
My first data analysis project, and my first taste of machine learning.

In this project I have taken theoretical insurance data in order to make a comparison between age and insurance cost.
Data is processed, plotted, assessed and reworked before finally extending the linear regressor to make predictions.
